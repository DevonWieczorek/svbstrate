# svbstrate [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/svbstrate.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svbstrate)
A low-level functional CSS library. Includes a CLI for ease of use.

**Note:** this library requires [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss). See the included `postcss.config.js` for configuration.

## Getting Started 
Install normally, then copy the files to your stylesheets directory:
```
npm i svbstrate --save
```
**Alternatively,** you can install svbstrate as a global module, and make use of its CLI tool.
```
npm i svbstrate -g

svbstrate init path/to/stylesheets/dir
```
